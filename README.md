I little bit to say
-----
The quantitative method mentioned in Microsoft's 2018 paper LQ-Nets: Learned Quantization for Highly
Accurate and Compact Deep Neural Networks is very interesting and I'm gonna apply it to my future research.

Anyway, I implemented the method in c as a try.

But this code only quantifies the weights and does not involve any learning process.

The original code is available at https://github.com/Microsoft/LQ-Nets if you're interested.
